# Bouzouki
Code repository for the Bouzouki website


This is a repository for the website I created for Bouzouki, a strip club in Detroit, Michigan. This is the only site I can confidently say I've designed, which only looks good because of the high-quality environment shots.

I also used a slideshow plugin, a responsive image plugin, and some very inelegant logic to determine which photos get displayed for which users. Desktop users would see the slideshow, whereas mobile users (with their limited bandwidth) wouldn't. I also created a custom pop-up menu and hamburger, animated with jQuery and some good ol' fashioned hackery. I honestly don't like strip clubs, but I'm quite proud of the minimalist design and the great photos.
